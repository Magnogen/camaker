###### https://magnogen.net/camaker Make your own Cellular Automata

Camaker (kam-akker, see-ay-may-ker, etc) is a way for you to make your own Cellular Automata with a friendly interface.
I'm not quite sure what that interface will look like yet, but I hope to take some inspiration from:

- [CellPond](https://cellpond.cool) ([CellPond's Repo](https://github.com/TodePond/CellPond))
- MarkovJunior's GUI-which-isnt-actually-a-GUI ([MarkovJunior's Repo](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior))

I guess we'll see how it goes!

At the moment, there is a rock-paper-scissors automata running when you load the page, but I hope to make that fully customisable.

Have fun!
